# Codex Instructions

- Read planning artifacts before analysis.
- Resolve the active `.mana` workspace before running planning, validation, PR readiness, or learning workflows.
- Load `.mana/global/service-mission.md`, `.mana/global/architecture.md`, and `.mana/global/engineering-guards.md` when present before producing recommendations.
- Treat violations of `.mana/global/engineering-guards.md` as blockers unless an accountable owner explicitly approves an exception.
- Write planning artifacts, validation reports, PR packages, developer handoff, and learning outputs into the active `.mana` workspace.
- Do not modify the same branch while Junie is actively editing it.
- Prefer reports, risk registers, and proposed patches over direct destructive edits.
- Respect MCP least privilege, redaction, approval, and audit policies.
- Stop on high-risk database, architecture, security, or cross-service blockers.
