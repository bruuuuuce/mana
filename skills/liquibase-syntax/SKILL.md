# Liquibase Syntax

## Purpose
Catch malformed changelogs, duplicate identifiers, missing author/id fields, invalid include paths, and obvious structural issues before deeper review.

This skill exists to reduce delivery churn by making a narrow, reusable judgement explicit. It produces structured artifacts and recommendations; it does not perform broad autonomous actions.

## When To Use It
- During the lifecycle phase indicated by the tags and preferred runner.
- When the required inputs are available and the team needs a repeatable review.
- Before a human approval gate where missing evidence would slow the team down.
- When a related agent invokes it as one step in a larger workflow.

## When Not To Use It
- Do not use it as a replacement for the accountable human owner.
- Do not use it for unrelated files, binary artifacts, or systems outside the approved MCP policy.
- Do not use it after the decision point if the finding can no longer influence the design without rework.
- Do not use it to justify unsafe shortcuts against project rules.

## Inputs
- changelog_files

## Outputs
- liquibase_syntax_report

## Execution Logic
1. Locate modified changelog files.
2. Run local validate command when available.
3. Perform fallback text checks when Liquibase is unavailable.
4. Report clear failures without touching databases.

## Decision Rules
- `blocker`: unresolved high-risk issue, missing critical input, unsafe database/security/architecture condition, or untestable requirement that prevents responsible delivery.
- `warning`: incomplete evidence, medium-risk design concern, missing non-critical test, or ambiguity that can be accepted by the owner.
- `info`: observation useful for reviewers, implementation, or future learning.

## Failure Modes
- Missing or stale input artifacts can produce false negatives.
- Repository search can miss dynamically configured flows or generated code.
- MCP access restrictions can prevent full validation; report the access gap explicitly.
- AI output can be incomplete; human review remains mandatory.

## Required Human Review
The owner role `Developer` reviews blocker and warning findings. High-risk security, database, concurrency, or architecture findings require explicit approval before implementation or merge.

## Interaction With Codex
Codex should run this skill for repository-level analysis, planning, validation, documentation, and report generation. Codex should prefer proposed patches and written findings over destructive edits.

## Interaction With Junie
Junie may use the output inside the IDE to implement one approved task at a time, generate local tests, or apply local fixes. Junie must not change files outside the approved impact map without asking.

## Interaction With MCP
MCP access must be least-privilege. Read-only access is preferred. Writes, destructive operations, external comments, database execution, or ticket updates require human approval and audit logging.

## Correct Usage Examples
- Run during the intended lifecycle phase with the full story, context, and linked artifacts available.
- Use the output as evidence for refinement, planning, review, or local implementation decisions.
- Escalate blocker findings to the named human owner before continuing.
- Store the generated report with the story or branch artifacts so later agents can reuse it.

## Incorrect Usage Examples
- Do not use this skill as an autonomous code-changing tool.
- Do not run it with only a title or vague one-line request and treat the result as complete.
- Do not ignore high-severity findings because the output is advisory.
- Do not use it to bypass team, architecture, DBA, security, or reviewer approval.

## Output Standard
Follow `docs/standards/agent-skill-output-standard.md` (Agent And Skill Output Standard) for all generated artifacts. Use `templates/standard-agent-skill-report.template.md` when no more specific template exists.

Internal reasoning must use compact caveman mode: terse fragments, evidence-first notes, no long narrative, and no private chain-of-thought in final artifacts.
